# Redash Terraform Provider

[![Actions Status][actions-image]][actions] [![Go Report Card][goreport-image]][goreport] [![Release][release-image]][releases] [![License][license-image]][license]

## Overview

Terraform provider for managing Redash configurations.

## Quick start

Assuming git is installed:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/htamakos/terraform-provider-redash
$ cd terraform-provider-redash
$ make test
$ make
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
$ make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
$ make format
```

**Note:** Always run `format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found
at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.

## Installation

First download the pre-compiled binary for your platform from the release assets at the following links or generate the
binaries locally using the provided `make` command:

https://github.com/htamakos/terraform-provider-redash/releases/latest

From here you will need to move the binary into your Terraform plugins directory - depending on your platform /
installation this might change but generally speaking they are located at:

* Darwin & Linux: `~/.terraform.d/plugins`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins`

## How to use?

### Setting up the provider

```hcl
# Minimal configuration
provider "redash" {
  redash_uri = "https://redash.exmaple.com"
  api_key    = "<YourPersonalAPIKeyHere>"
}
```

To avoid exposing your secret API key in code you can, preferrably, set it as a value of an environment variable
named `REDASH_API_KEY`. The API key can be found on your Redash profile page.

```bash
$ export REDASH_API_KEY="<YourPersonalAPIKeyHere>"
```

With the provider configured, we can now use data sources and manage resources.

### Users

```hcl
data "redash_user" "rrunner" {
  id = 1
}

resource "redash_user" "wcoyote" {
  name   = "Wile E. Coyote"
  email  = "wcoyote@acme.com"
  groups = [32, 1]
}

```

### Groups

```hcl
data "redash_group" "geniuses" {
  id = 35
}

resource "redash_group" "runners" {
  name = "Beep Beep"
}
```

### Data Sources

Please note that the list of required/accepted options varies wildly by type. This is entirely dependent on the Redash
installation that you are connecting to. For a detailed list of types and options, you can GET from
the `/api/data_sources/types` endpoint on your Redash instance.

```hcl
data "redash_data_source" "acme_corp" {
  id = 123
}

resource "redash_data_source" "acme_corp" {
  name = "ACME Corporation Product Database"
  type = "redshift"

  options {
    host     = "newproducts.acme.com"
    port     = 5439
    dbname   = "products"
    user     = "wcoyote"
    password = "eth3LbeRt"
  }
}

resource "redash_group_data_source_attachment" "wcoyote_acme" {
  group_id       = redash_group.geniuses.id
  data_source_id = redash_data_source.acme_corp.id
}
```

### Queries

```hcl
data "redash_query" "my_query" {
  id = 1
}

resource "redash_query" "my_query" {
  name           = "My Query"
  data_source_id = redash_data_source.acme_corp.id
  query          = "SELECT 1 + 1"
  description    = "A query like no other"
}
```

### Dashboards

```hcl
data "redash_dashboard" "existing_dashboard" {
  slug = "my-dashboard"
}

resource "redash_dashboard" "my_dashboard" {
  name = "My dashboard"
}
```

### Visualizations

```hcl
data "redash_visualization" "this" {
  query_id         = 1
  visualization_id = 7
}

resource "redash_visualization" "table" {
  query_id = 1
  name     = "Results table"
  type     = "TABLE"
}
```

### Widgets

```hcl
data "redash_widget" "this" {
  id             = 27
  dashboard_slug = "service-slos"
}

resource "redash_widget" "text_widget" {
  dashboard_slug = redash_dashboard.this.slug
  text           = "Welcome to my dashboard"
}

resource "redash_widget" "visualization_widget" {
  dashboard_slug   = redash_dashboard.this.slug
  visualization_id = 1
}
```

### Publishing

This is handled through CI/CD on Github Actions. However all binaries will be generated by using the `make` command for
local publishing.
